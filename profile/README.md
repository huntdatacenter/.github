## Welcome to HUNT Cloud

🧙‍♂️ We are a small team of scientific instrument makers located at NTNU, Norway.

🔬 [HUNT Cloud](https://docs.hdc.ntnu.no/) provides services for sensitive data analysis. Our services include solutions for data storage, data computation and data transfers within a high-trust framework.

🧪 The HUNT Study has handled sensitive digital information since 1984. [HUNT Cloud](https://docs.hdc.ntnu.no/) was established in 2013 to elevate the collection, accessibility and exploration of large scale information. HUNT Cloud is owned by [NTNU](https://ntnu.edu) and operated by [HUNT Research Centre](https://www.ntnu.edu/hunt) at the Department of Public Health and Nursing at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences.
